### Assignment Issues
It took a lot of trial and error to figure out the best way to setup the CSS code so that it interacted with the javascript without being too complicated and messy. 

### Outside Sources
I used some of my class notes as a reference for getting the Javascript code started.

I also used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7048313/how-to-have-multiple-css-transitions-on-an-element to figure out how to add multiple different CSS transition properties within the same class.
